What is the procedure for copying migration projects?,0.8,0.9,0.7,61.64,"The SYSTEM RESPONSE is largely derived from the RETRIEVED CONTEXT, especially from the repeated sections describing the procedure for copying migration projects in SAP S/4HANA On-Premise. However, the mention of 'across all versions' and specific version numbers introduces a bit of external information, reducing faithfulness to 0.8. The system response directly answers the user's question, hence the high relevance score of 0.9. The context precision is 0.7, as while the system uses parts of the retrieved context to answer the question, it does not utilize all provided sources equally, and some sources (like those discussing data migration in SAP S/4HANA Cloud) are less relevant to the specific question about copying migration projects."
How can I manage returnable packaging logistics in S/4HANA?,0.8,0.9,0.7,93.14,"The system response is largely derived from the retrieved context, but includes some external information and examples. The response directly answers the user question and uses a significant portion of the retrieved context, but not all of it is relevant or useful."
What are the search categories for packing instructions?,0.8,0.6,0.4,69.5,"The system response is derived from the retrieved context, but it only partially answers the user question. The response provides some search categories for packing instructions, but it does not fully address the question. The context precision is low because most of the retrieved context is not useful for answering the question, and the system response only uses a small portion of it."
Can I create text items in packing instructions?,1.0,1.0,0.8,106.65,"The system response is derived directly from the retrieved context, making it faithful. The response directly answers the user's question about creating text items in packing instructions, thus being relevant. However, not all of the retrieved context was necessary to answer the question, which is why the precision score is not perfect."
How do I track movements to returnable packaging accounts?,0.9,0.8,0.7,75.85,"The system response is derived primarily from the retrieved context, but contains minor rephrasing which might be considered as external information. It directly answers the user question, but some parts of the context were not used to generate the answer."
